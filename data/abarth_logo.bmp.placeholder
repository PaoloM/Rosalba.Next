# Abarth Logo Placeholder

This file represents where the abarth_logo.bmp should be placed.

The actual BMP file should be:
- Format: 24-bit BMP
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or smaller
- Optimized for the display resolution (320x480)

To add the real logo:
1. Convert your Abarth logo to BMP format
2. Resize to appropriate dimensions
3. Replace this file with the actual abarth_logo.bmp

The screen manager will automatically load this image during splash screen initialization.
